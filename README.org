* menus
  Just some menus. An fzf/dmenu kind of menus.

** Usage
   Just run ~menus~. This will show:
   - fixed pinned programs (will add an option later)
   - binaries in your PATH (just like dmenu_run)
   - keyboard shortcuts (if you have sxhkd setup with nice comments)
   - power options (with systemctl)
   - current program menu bar if it supports it (like HUD)
   - a calculator (for dmenu incremental patch)

   Note that recent items are also cached so that it knows what you need in the future.

** Installation
   First, make sure dependancies are installed:
   - fzf or dmenu (preferably with the [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/incremental][incremental patch]])
   - xprop
   - xdotool
   - systemctl (sorry)

   Then:
   #+begin_src shell
     $ sudo pip3 install .
   #+end_src

** Setup HUD
   Add to your ~.xinitrc~ or anywhere else you find suitable:
   #+begin_src shell
     eval "$(menus hud env)"
     menus hud daemon &
   #+end_src

   [[https://github.com/p-e-w/plotinus][plotinus]] is also optionally supported. So, install it if you like. This can be helpful for some GTK programs.

** Config
   #+begin_src shell-script
     export MENUS_INTERFACE='fzf'
     export TUI_APPS='music-player:lf:vis:corona:alsamixer:lyrics:nano:dice:fmz'
   #+end_src
